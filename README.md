3d Print Physics Experiments with optional PhyPhox Measuring

## Goal
The goal of this project is to create affordable experiments for the use in physics-classes, using 3D-printing.
For the measurements in the Experiments you can use PhyPhox in combination with the esp32 or other arduino-compatible interfaces.
